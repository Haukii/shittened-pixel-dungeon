scenes.aboutscene.wisdom_18=Fear not the pigeon, for in its flappy majesty lies the secret to conquering the cosmic dance of life. Embrace the winged wisdom of the pigeon, and let its coos be the rhythm to which your ambitions pirouette through the kaleidoscope of existence.\n\nPicture this: you, my splendid cosmic comrade, are the interstellar maestro, conducting the symphony of your own peculiar existence. Be the maestro whose baton is a glow-in-the-dark baguette, leading an orchestra of rubber ducks playing a concerto of quantum quirkiness.\n\nIn this cosmic carnival, dare to be the unicycle-riding tightrope walker, juggling flaming marshmallows while reciting Shakespearean sonnets backwards. Fear not the absurdity, for in the heart of the bizarre, you'll find the elixir of audacity.\n\nAs you traverse the wacky warp zone of life, remember that the mundane is the canvas upon which you paint your extraordinary. Turn your Mondays into trampoline parties and your setbacks into trampolines themselves, bouncing you higher toward the constellation of your dreams.\n\nFear not the pigeon; instead, envision yourself as the pigeon wizard, casting spells of serendipity and turning breadcrumbs into golden opportunities. Let your imagination soar higher than a caffeinated pterodactyl on a sugar rush.

scenes.aboutscene.wisdom_21=The bomb seal can be blown up.
scenes.aboutscene.wisdom_22=My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead? murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ? something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ? uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" ? on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.

scenes.welcomescene.welcome_msg=Welcome to Shittened Pixel Dungeon!\n\n\n\nThere are very few actually positive changes in this mod. Just start a new run and be ready to be confused by all the dumb changes. _This mod contains a lot of audio changes_, so please use audio if possible (please do not use audio, unless you want permanent hearing and brain damage). A lot of the _audio will be loud_. Also I've replaced pretty much all the music in this game, and they're now from MANY genres, so if you don't like something, maybe don't disable music because there will be another genre of music in other lvls \n\nAlso also please understand this was made on my free time and some of the changes may be cringy and/or poorly implemented.\n\n "This is a complete shitshow" -a (imaginary) friend
