# Shittened Pixel Dungeon

#### Hey, This mod is still under development. Files in github should compile, but the game will likely crash often.

A annoyingly stupid mod of [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon), by [Evan Debenham](https://shatteredpixel.com/about/). Which was based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://www.watabou.ru).

Shittened Pixel Dungeon currently SHOULD compile for Android and Desktop platforms, hopefully. It is available on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Haukii/shittened-pixel-dungeon).

If you like this mod, please consider [supporting the hardworking developer behind all the actually playable portions of the game on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ShatteredPixel)!

If you'd like to work with the code, I guess you can. But for your own safety, stay away. Feel free to steal any assets into your own mods or other projects.
